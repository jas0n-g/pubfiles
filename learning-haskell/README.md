## 2024.03.01 Notes

* Just finished chapter 2
* I feel like I understand lists better because my calc class is reviewing series and sequences
* I think I'm understanding a little bit of set theory
  * List comprehension makes sense when I think of them like they are loops
* Been mainly using the language through the REPL, just loading in files rather than compiling them
  * Maybe later in the book we will cover compilation, but if not, I'll figure it out
* I think at the end of the book I want to try out an Advent of Code season in Haskell, but I'll see.
