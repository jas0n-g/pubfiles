### Basics

* Finished `Basics` part of the tour.
* Makes sense so far
* I know this is an impure functional language but it is still weird seeing mutable variables
* Pretty simple, a lot of the syntax and concepts are the same as other languages, unlike Haskell
* I really like no opeartor overloading for ints and floats

### Functions

* Pipelines are super nice!
* I feel like I understand the function captures more because I understand currying from Haskell.
* Labeled arguments seem like a very, very useful feature for readability

### Flow Control

* Pretty similar to Haskell flow control
* Pattern matching is amazing and is very powerful
* I like how flow control is basically just a switch statement
  * Unlike Haskell, which has pattern matching both in just function defintions and in where expressions, as well as guards
    * In Gleam, this all falls under case expressions
* I think I understand the difference between
