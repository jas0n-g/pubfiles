### Basics

* Finished `Basics` part of the tour.
* Makes sense so far
* I know this is an impure functional language but it is still weird seeing mutable variables
* Pretty simple, a lot of the syntax and concepts are the same as other languages, unlike Haskell
* I really like no opeartor overloading for ints and floats
