# Learning C++

Using [codeacademy's "C++ for Programmers"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/c-plus-plus-for-programmers) course to learn C++.

## 2024.03.18 Notes

* The [codeacademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/c-plus-plus-for-programmers) is using [Google's C++ Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
* Although the course is recommending `gcc`, I will use `clang`.
* I/O is kinda like C, but input is easier using `std::cin`.
