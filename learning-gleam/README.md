The first pass of the tour.

Overall, I really enjoy the simplicity of the language. It takes what I like from C and Haskell, simplicity and functional programming. I definitely need more practice though.

### Basics

* Finished `Basics` part of the tour.
* Makes sense so far
* I know this is an impure functional language but it is still weird seeing mutable variables
* Pretty simple, a lot of the syntax and concepts are the same as other languages, unlike Haskell
* I really like no opeartor overloading for ints and floats

### Functions

* Pipelines are super nice!
* I feel like I understand the function captures more because I understand currying from Haskell.
* Labeled arguments seem like a very, very useful feature for readability

### Flow Control

* Pretty similar to Haskell flow control
* Pattern matching is amazing and is very powerful
* I like how flow control is basically just a switch statement
  * Unlike Haskell, which has pattern matching both in just function defintions and in where expressions, as well as guards
    * In Gleam, this all falls under case expressions
* I think I understand the difference between

### Data Types

* I thought this was way easier to reason about compared to Haskell's type system
  * Might just because the book explained it too strangely
* Comparing variants to enums and records to structs makes alot of sense
* I think `Results` are the best things in the world for error handling

### Standard Library

* Mostly quality of life things
* If I need anything, at least there are good docs

### Advanced Features

* `Use` seems super useful
* I will definitely try to avoid panics and let asserts
* I wonder if I can use C for externals

* I think I just have to think about how to solve a problem rather than worrying about whether the course has covered it yet.
* I really, really love the language, it just feels too young or has too much abstraction to use for writing some things.
  * Mainly I can't figure out how to read from a file.
* I will continue with it, but I will put it on the backburner as I learn other stuff.
