## 2024.03.01 Notes

* Just finished chapter 2
* I feel like I understand lists better because my calc class is reviewing series and sequences
* I think I'm understanding a little bit of set theory
  * List comprehension makes sense when I think of them like they are loops
* Been mainly using the language through the REPL, just loading in files rather than compiling them
  * Maybe later in the book we will cover compilation, but if not, I'll figure it out
* I think at the end of the book I want to try out an Advent of Code season in Haskell, but I'll see

## 2024.03.02 Notes

* Just finished chpater 3, I think I might need to reread it again
* It draws a lot of comparison to generics and type interfaces, which I don't really know much about
  * I do think I understand the concept of a typeclass though, so if I ever have to deal with them in other programming langauges, I can draw parallels to Haskell
* I love the fact that Haskell is statically typed, and it makes sense with how everything is an expression/function and how mutability works in the language
* Upon reread things are clearer
* Type variables are kinda like working with types with the PreProc.

## 2024.03.03 Notes

* Just finished chapter 4
* Definitely need to reread it to understand everything
* These all feel like variations of `case` or `if - else if - else` in `C`, except more powerful
* I think pattern matching is only ever really useful lists, I would most likely use guards in other scenarios
  * | guards           | match against value                   |
    | pattern matching | match against value **and structure** |
* Reminds me of how powerful expressions are in Haskell
* I've seen `let` and `in` before using Nix
